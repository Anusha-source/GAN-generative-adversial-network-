Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an exciting recent innovation in machine learning. GANs are generative models: they create new data instances that resemble your training data.
The Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN for short, is an architecture for training a generative model.

The architecture is comprised of two models. The generator that we are interested in, and a discriminator model that is used to assist in the training of the generator. Initially, both of the generator and discriminator models were implemented as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), although more recently, the models are implemented as deep convolutional neural networks.

It can be challenging to understand how a GAN is trained and exactly how to understand and implement the loss function for the generator and discriminator models.
